Details about `RMarkdown/` folder.

## Note
The most important files in this folder are `Publish_appendices.Rmd` and `Publish_appendices.pdf`, which are the R code appendices I made to accompany the publication. Scripts themselves are pretty well annotated, so I stopped recording analysis in R Markdown form. All files whose name starts with a date are old analyses that have since been replaced or discontinued (see scripts instead).  
\
The `sequencing/` folder is also useful because it contains details about how I did the 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing analysis, with a walkthrough of how to use UA HPC. This includes FAPROTAX and FUNGuild analyses.
