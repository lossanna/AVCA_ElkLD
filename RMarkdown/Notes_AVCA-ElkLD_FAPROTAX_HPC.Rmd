### Background 
- FAPROTAX assigns putative functions based on taxonomy for 16S data. Analysis requires cleaned ASV and taxonomy tables (DADA2 pipeline completed and contaminants removed).
  - ASV table: each row is a sample, each column is is an ASV.
  - Taxonomy table: each row is an ASV, and the columns are taxonomy classifications (kingdom, phylum, etc.).
