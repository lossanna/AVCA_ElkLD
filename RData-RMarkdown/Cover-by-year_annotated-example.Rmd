# Introduction
- The `AVCA_ElkLD/scripts/Cover-by-year-and-channel.R` script graphs plant and ground cover over time for each channel, and does comparison of means (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis) for select groups.
- This follows data wrangling (`AVCA_ElkLD/scripts/data-wrangling/`), summarising by channel (`AVCA_ElkLD/scripts/data-wrangling/Summarise-all-channels.R`). See the annotated examples for those scripts in the `AVCA_ElkLD/RData-RMarkdown/` folder.
