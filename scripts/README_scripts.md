    - Created 2023-03-24 as a place for prior analysis that has since been discontinued (have been replaced by better grouping and statistical models); usually uses data from `data/cleaned/old-summarised/` folder.
    - Lines of code to write out figures have been deleted (unless for SRM 2022 & SRM 2023), so figures won't accidentally be overwritten by old analysis (no need to save old figures in their own folder to write out separately again).
    - Not intended to run - some paths may not work, as files and folders may have changed names.
